First impressions It seems every course has pre-requisites. A course c would have the following pre-requisites: [c, p1], [c, p2], .... First we finish all the pre-requisites then we can finish the course c. The pre-requisites will obviously have their own pre-requisites&amp;hellip; and so on. The question says &amp;ldquo;is it possible?&amp;rdquo; which means the inputs may have a situation where this chain of pre-requisites can never be completed because everything depends on everything else i.</description>

Exploration The first instinct is to lower the dimension of the problem and see what that looks like. A 1D world with stretches of land and water:
                 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1    In this case, there are 3 islands. We can count this in a single pass of the array.</description>

      <description>Note:
The order of returned grid coordinates does not matter. Both m and n are less than 150.

 Intuitions The question directly gives us a way to visualize the matrix: as an elevation map. Following is a matrix and the corresponding elevation map:
 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
~ 1 2 2 3 (5) *
~ 3 2 3 (4) (4) *
~ 2 4 (5) 3 1 *</description>
