      <title>Algo walkthrough: product of array except self</title>

      <description>Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
Link to the problem.
 What not to do Let&amp;rsquo;s ignore the note for now.
Using division If we use division, how would we solve this problem? We could start with a single pass over the array. In this pass, we multiply all the elements and calculate complete_product. For each element e, we can now calculate \(\frac{complete-product}{e}\).</description>

      <title>Algo walkthrough: spiral matrix</title>

      <description>Example 1:
Input matrix: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
Link to the problem.
 Intuitions Track the spiral literally I can definitely think of at least one solution involving 4 pointers . The 4 pointers track the size of the matrix as the spiral closes inwards.
  But how to track the current location? A tuple with row and column numbers? At first we set direction to move towards right. When the column number reaches a value equal to right we change direction to move downwards.</description>

      <title>Algo walkthrough: longest sequence in unsorted array</title>

      <description>Link to the problem.
Hints  They hint at a \(O(n)\) solution. This can be useful at a later point. They also say the length of the array can be between \(1, 10000\). This means we can a small array of size \(10\) and manually try out solutions. This would probably scale fine. Each element can be huge! \(-10^9, 10^9\). Note that the value is higher than the length of the array.</description>

      <title>Algo walkthrough: swapping elements to find max score</title>

      <description>Initial setup The initial setup consists of an unsorted array. Each element has a score defined as the absolute value of the difference the element&amp;rsquo;s value and its index.
The absolute value The metric for each element gives us a sense of displacement. For example, if an element at index `4` is of value `10` the score for this is `6`. If the element was at index `5` and of value `11`, the score is still `6`.</description>
