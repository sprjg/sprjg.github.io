      <description>The problem We have an unsorted array. It may or may not have a sequence of numbers. We have to find the length of the longest sequence. Link to the problem.
Hints  They hint at a \(O(n)\) solution. This can be useful at a later point. They also say the length of the array can be between \(1, 10000\). This means we can a small array of size \(10\) and manually try out solutions.</description>

      <description>Problem statement Given an array of size \(n\), the beauty of this array is defined as sum of \(abs(index-value)\) for each element. Swapping two elements of this array, what is the maximum beauty possible?
Initial setup The initial setup consists of an unsorted array. Each element has a score defined as the absolute value of the difference the element&amp;rsquo;s value and its index.
The absolute value The metric for each element gives us a sense of displacement.</description>
