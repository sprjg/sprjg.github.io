      <description>The problem  Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order. Example 1: Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
 Link to the problem.
Intuitions Track the spiral literally I can definitely think of at least one solution involving 4 pointers . The 4 pointers track the size of the matrix as the spiral closes inwards.
  But how to track the current location?</description>

      <description>The problem Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its row and column to 0&#39;s. Link to the problem.
Hints  A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution? So this problem is more about space than time.   Intuitions It seems obvious that a single pass through the matrix would work.</description>
