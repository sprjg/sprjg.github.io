      <description>The problem Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its row and column to 0&#39;s. Link to the problem.
Hints  A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution? So this problem is more about space than time.   Intuitions It seems obvious that a single pass through the matrix would work.</description>
