      <description>The problem  There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1. Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1] Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
